<h2 id='description'>Description</h2>
  
<p> Country music is changing day by day and slowly getting a new twist of folk and bluegrass. One particular artist has made this the trend. As this new style of country comes in, people are now wondering; Who is he? Where is he from? When will he tour? He is becoming loved by all of the people in the universe. As the agents assigned to the case we must figure out who he is in order to give him the credit that he deserves. Many people worldwide are wondering when he will tour and when his next album is coming out. In order to find out this information and give it to his fans, we must track him down and find out the names of his six albums and their release year. Once finding out the names of the albums and their release year we will have enough information to track him down. Tracking him down will lead to him getting the recognition he deserves and the world will finally find out who he is and can now follow him. The country music industry depends on us. We must find him and name him the face of modern day country music. He has brought back the style of old country that we love while mixing in deep meaningful lyrics. The man who was once known as the “mystery musician” will soon be known by name.
