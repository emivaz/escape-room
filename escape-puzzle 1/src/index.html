<p>Well, tonight I'm up in Chillicothe <br>
Downwind from the paper mill<br>
I'm out here spittin' on the sidewalk<br>
Takin' in the factory smells<br>
  <br>
And I know she tends to smokin' out the window<br>
In the air of that gas pipe leak<br>
I wonder if she's cringin' at same time<br>
Thinkin' pretty thoughts of me<br>
  <br>
I was up for hours this mornin'<br>
Pullin' traps 'fore I said goodbye<br>
I plan to tan myself a fox hide<br>
And hang it on my darlin' bride<br>
  <br>
'Cause they tell me that it's gonna be a big one<br>
And the snow is settin' in<br>
And I don't want her cold while I ain't at home<br>
The way that I've been<br>
  <br>
Spendin' my nights in a bar room, Lord<br>
Turnin' them songs into two by fours<br>
Dreamin' 'bout the day that I sit by the fire<br>
Huddled with my honey in our Country Squire<br>
  <br>
Well, tomorrow we hit the country music highway<br>
On our way to Circleville<br>
We're off to do some weekend warrin'<br>
While we sing and drink our fill<br>
  <br>
And when I ain't out playin' on my six string<br>
With the nickles I acquire<br>
I'm tryin' to fix her up a castle<br>
It's called the Country Squire<br>
  <br>
It's a twenty four foot long vessel<br>
It measures eight feet wide<br>
It's a fifty-three year old camper<br>
It's made to pull behind<br>
  <br>
And I've gutted to the studs and the rafters<br>
And I'm buildin' back piece by piece<br>
I'm tryin' to fix her up a temple<br>
My lady of the Estill Springs<br>
  <br>
Spendin' my nights in a bar room, Lord<br>
Turnin' them songs into two by fours<br>
Dreamin' 'bout the day that I sit by the fire<br>
Huddled with my honey in our Country Squire<br>
  <br>
One day I aim to have myself a family<br>
And a cabin on the hill<br>
And I might have to come off of the highway<br>
To help with the family bills<br>
  <br>
But when the kids have got a little older<br>
On the day that I retire<br>
I'll take her somewhere warm for the winter<br>
Pullin' our Country Squire<br>
  <br>
Spendin' my nights in a bar room, Lord<br>
Turnin' them songs into two by fours<br>
Dreamin' 'bout the day that sit by the fire<br>
Huddled with my honey in our Country Squire<br>
  <br>
Dreamin' 'bout the day that I sit by the fire<br>
  Huddled with my honey in our Country Squire</p>
