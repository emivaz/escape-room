<h1> Welcome to the Unscramble! </h1>

<h2 id="directions"> The artist gave us an unscramble puzzle to try to figure out one of his album names! He said that the Phrase is three words, first word is 7 letters and starts with a B, second word is three letters and starts with an A, and the third word is 6 letters and also starts with a B. Please help us figure out what the album name is! When finished with the puzzle and you have the next number you need, press the button that says "next room" at the bottom. </h2>
